## Coursera Data Science 3 Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains codes and documentation for a simple program "run_analysis.R"
which calculates mean values by subject and activity for various mean and standard deviation (std)
parameters of data recorded from devices worn by subjects in a variety of activities. The output
is a tab-delimited file named "tidydata.txt" with column headers included. See CodeBook.md for
particulars on the data processing.

### Data Set Information:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, 
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its 
embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 
3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded 
to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets,
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters 
and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window).
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, 
was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, 
therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables 
from the time and frequency domain.

### Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
